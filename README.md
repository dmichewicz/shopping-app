Shopping app that I made to solve the problem of making a shopping list. Instead of thinking about what I have to buy I can simply check products that have been defined in the database and add them to the list. The list is sortable and products that's been already put in the basket move to the end of the list. List is stored in the local storage so it doesn't clear after closing a browser.

First page is for adding products to the list. They are sorted by categories so you can simply display products from chosen category. There's also a search feature that works live and allows to quickly find a product.

Second Page is the list. It also has a search feature and categories filter. Both work same as on the first page.

Global features are: 

- adding custom product
- clearing the list
